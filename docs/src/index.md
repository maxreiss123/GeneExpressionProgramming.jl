## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/maxreiss123/GeneExpressionProgramming.jl.git")

using GeneExpressionProgramming
using Random

# Generate sample data
Random.seed!(42)
x_data = randn(100, 2)
y_data = @. x_data[:,1]^2 + x_data[:,2]

# Create and train regressor
regressor = GepRegressor(2)
fit!(regressor, 1000, 1000, x_data', y_data; loss_fun="mse")

# View the discovered expression
println(regressor.best_models_[1].compiled_function)
# Output: x1 * x1 + x2
```
